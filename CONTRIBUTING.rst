Contributing to the library
===========================

Whether they come in the form of providing a fix for a current `issue
<https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching/issues>`_, reporting a bug, an
enhancement to the code itself, or a discussion of the library as a whole,
contributions are always welcome. Pull requests (PRs) will be reviewed, and
collaborative work is encouraged!

To make a contribution via a PR, follow these steps:

1. Go to the `GitHub repo <https://github.com/daffidwilde/matching>`_,
   make a fork, and clone the repo locally::

       $ git clone git@github.com/<your-username>/matching.git

2. Ensure that all the tests pass (this can take a few minutes)::

       $ cd matching
       $ pytest tests

3. Make your changes and write tests to go with them -- ensuring they pass, too.

4. Push to your fork and open a pull request!
